# Product Image Analysis and Enhancement System Documentation

## Executive Summary

This documentation outlines a proof-of-concept system that leverages multimodal generative AI for e-commerce product image analysis and enhancement. The system serves two primary functions:

1. Automated validation of product listing images against established e-commerce optimization criteria
2. Generative transformation of product images for seasonal marketing campaigns

The implementation integrates multiple AI services, including HuggingFace's vision-language models, OpenAI's image generation capabilities, and Azure's Computer Vision services, creating a comprehensive solution for e-commerce image optimization.

## Technical Architecture Overview

### Core Components

- **Framework**: FastAPI-based RESTful API
- **Authentication**: API Key-based header authentication system
- **AI Integration Layer**: 
  - HuggingFace Inference API for multimodal analysis
  - OpenAI API for image generation
  - Azure Computer Vision for smart cropping
  - Segmind API for advanced image inpainting

### Environmental Configuration

The system requires the following environment variables for AI service integration:

```bash
HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN=<token>
AZURE_VISION_ENDPOINT=<endpoint>
AZURE_VISION_KEY=<key>
SEGMIND_API_KEY=<key>
```

### Dependency Framework

```bash
pip install fastapi pillow python-dotenv huggingface-hub openai azure-ai-vision requests
```

## Implementation Guide

### Base Configuration

```python
import requests
import json

API_BASE_URL = "http://your-api-base-url"
API_KEY = "your_api_key"

headers = {
    "X-API-Key": API_KEY,
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}
```

### Product Image Validation Implementation

The system employs a panel-based expert system approach for image validation:

```python
# Example: Batch image validation request
validation_payload = {
    "urls": [
        "https://example.com/product1.jpg",
        "https://example.com/product2.jpg"
    ]
}

response = requests.post(
    f"{API_BASE_URL}/process-images",
    headers=headers,
    json=validation_payload
)
```

## API Endpoint Specifications

### 1. Product Image Analysis Endpoint
**POST** `/process-images`

Implements a multi-criteria evaluation system for product images using a simulated expert panel approach.

Request Schema:
```json
{
    "urls": [
        "string"  // Array of image URLs
    ]
}
```

Response Schema:
```json
{
    "model_response": {
        "dimension": boolean,  // Presence of dimensional information
        "angle": boolean,      // Multiple angle coverage
        "lifestyle": boolean   // Contextual usage representation
    },
    "input_messages": [
        {
            "role": "string",
            "content": []
        }
    ]
}
```

### 2. Seasonal Image Generation - Basic
**POST** `/generate_image_basic`

Implements smart cropping and background modification for seasonal marketing adaptations.

Request Schema:
```json
{
    "url": "string"  // Product image URL
}
```

### 3. Advanced Image Generation
**POST** `/generate_image_advanced`

Employs advanced inpainting techniques for sophisticated seasonal theme integration.

Response Type: JPEG image data

### 4. Generated Image Quality Assessment
**POST** `/evaluate_generated_image`

Implements quality control validation for AI-generated marketing assets.

Request Schema:
```json
{
    "urls": [
        "string"  // Generated image URLs
    ]
}
```

Response Schema:
```json
{
    "model_response": {
        "isValid": boolean,        // Quality validation result
        "imageSlogan": "string"    // AI-generated marketing text
    },
    "input_messages": []
}
```

## Error Response Framework

The system implements standardized HTTP status codes with detailed error messaging:

```json
{
    "detail": "Error message specification"
}
```

Status Code Implementation:
- 200: Successful operation
- 400: Invalid request parameters
- 401: Authentication failure
- 500: System-level error

## Development Environment Configuration

Local development server initialization:
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 10000
```

Interactive API documentation access: `/docs` endpoint

## Validation Methodology

The system employs three primary validation vectors:

1. **Dimensional Compliance**
   - Verification of product measurement representation
   - Technical specification visibility assessment

2. **Angular Coverage Analysis**
   - Multiple perspective representation
   - Product feature visibility assessment

3. **Contextual Integration**
   - Usage scenario representation
   - Lifestyle context evaluation

The validation methodology employs a consensus-based approach through simulated expert panel evaluation, providing comprehensive assessment across multiple e-commerce optimization criteria.
